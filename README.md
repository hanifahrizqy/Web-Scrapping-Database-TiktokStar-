# Web-Scrapping-Database-TiktokStar-
This project's aim is to have some database of anything i could get from any website, and for now i chose 'Famous TiktokStar' website because for now and the past few years ago tik tok has been successed in the entertainment industry, so with no hesitate i made the top 48 famous tik tok in the world based on that website.
Why is it just only 48 people, it's because in the website just that information appears and i hope it could help with people get information like the social media company or the company related to.

Overview for steps i used:
1. Collected data from website to get the information of famous tiktokstar in the website.

2. Made it with python Jupiter notebook and BeautifulSoup and Pandas library.

3. And first, I scrapped the information in that page and there's only one page for tiktok famous in that website

4. Then, I scrapped in each name for their biography and background story. And it appears simply in my Google sheets in my website portfolio "fkjsfskj.abcs.com"
